    <h2>About Brian Lloyd of Dallas</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>
        Don't sign any additional warranty coverages, it's a scam. You can buy any of the "protectants" at any autostore for $15. Then when you try to cancel the warranty the next day, it will take over 4 months at the cost of $600 and many repeated and unreturned phone calls to the dealership, to the third party warranty provider, and to BMW Financial to see if the cancellation has been processed.
      </p></br>
      <p>
        I leased the car 1/14, requested the warranty cancellation 1/15, and as of 4/9, I have forced to pay an additional $600 for the warranty I requested to be cancelled. As of today, all calls made to Brian Lloyd (the finance guy), who has returned only two of twice a month status update calls,  have been met with a "the warranty cancellation is still being processed".  
      </p></br>
      <p>
        I would reccomend my salesperson, Curt and everyone else on the staff except for Brian in finance.
      </p>  
      <p>  
        Just called the third party warranty provider and they have not receieved a cancellation notice from this dealership, so Brian Lloyd is not only a scammer, but a liar.
      </p></br>
      <p>  
        I would like to mention that the rest of the staff resolved my issue quickly and with no trouble.
